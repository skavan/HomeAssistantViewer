## HomeAssistant Viewer

A simple desktop home assistant viewer app, designed to conserve real estate. I hate having a full browser on my desktop and wanted a simple, phone like window.
It's C# and uses Edge as the embedded browser.

You must edit `settings.json` to include your own HomeAssistant target URL.

The little icons on the title bar, let you switch sizes quickly and you can set your default sizes in `settings.json`.

A zip file is included with the necessary files to run the app - but best practice would be to recompile in Visual Studio 2022. <br><br><br>
